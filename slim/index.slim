        p Attila's love for food began when he was a ten year old watching his grand- mother in awe as she baked in their small kitchen in Budapest. Since arriving in Britain, Attila has worked his way up to sous chef in the award winning Michelin star Chapters Restaurants. His love and passion for food is not only exemplified in the menu, but also infectious.

            p Spring is in the air & this month at Anfora weâ€™re adding a little (very much needed) sunshine to our wine flight. The journey begins with a beautifully balanced sparkling rose from the Bugey region in France. Moving further north we discover the delights of Alsace. The Gewurztraminer Reserve is a testimonial of floral, citrus & exotic fruits. Then the New World throws up the challenge with a masterful Mornington Chardonnay from Crittenden estate in Australia. We finish with a very underrated Sangiovese. Pure, fresh with a welcoming smile from Tuscany
